 - Installed Laravel 8, Vue for front end, Vue Draggable component for the drag and drop 
 - Draggable - https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable -  
 - composer install
 - valet link if using valet. php artisan serve is also an option
 - create mysql database named task_management
 - php artisan migrate to migrate
 - taskManagement.test to see in browser with Valet or php artisan serve if not using valet
 - create, edit, delete, and reorder tasks
 - prioritize based on reordering

 - Crediting work of Andre Madarang in the video "Vue.Draggable with Laravel Example 1" for the help with the updating of task priorities, specifically the double foreach loop in the update method of the Task Controller. Also grabbed some basic styling and then simplified it for my purposes from the css from the Draggable example. 

 - Thanks for the opportunity to showcase my skills, this was a very fair skills test for the time.
